|------------|-------------|
| [HW00](HW00/HW00.pdf) | Introduction to C language basics and development environment setup. |
| [HW01](HW01/HW01.pdf) | Fundamental practice with input/output operations, conditional statements, and the Euclidean algorithm. |
| [HW02](HW02/HW02.pdf) | Writing structured C programs with sequential execution of functions, focusing on arithmetic operations and user input validation. |
| [HW03](HW03/HW03.pdf) | Creation of an interactive text-based puzzle game emphasizing user-controlled navigation and game state management. |
| [HW04](HW04/HW04.pdf) | Development of a menu-driven program for managing restaurant orders, applying discounts, and generating receipts. |
| [HW05](HW05/HW05.pdf) | Implementation of advanced C programming concepts including file I/O, enumerations, and game logic. |
| [HW06](HW06/HW06.pdf) | Design and implementation of an inventory management system for a supermarket, integrating file handling and data manipulation. |
| [HW08](HW08/HW08.pdf) | Creation of an 8-puzzle game incorporating user interaction, score tracking, and automated solving algorithms. |
| [HW09](HW09/HW09.pdf) | Development of the classic Snake game with dynamic memory allocation, focusing on game mechanics and data structures. |
| [HW10](HW10/HW10.pdf) | Implementation of a library book management system using linked lists and persistent storage techniques. |
| [HW12](HW12/HW12.pdf) | Practical application of data serialization and deserialization techniques for managing linked lists with different structure types. |

These assignments cover a wide range of topics in computer programming, providing students with hands-on experience in problem-solving, algorithm design, and software development using the C programming language.
